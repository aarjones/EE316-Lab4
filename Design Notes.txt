ToDo:
	Write Hangman Program in Java
		Backend for this piece, not the GUI.
		Take in word, then characters.
		Keep integer count of the number of mistakes.
		Print out the updated String each time correct character is guessed
	Java GUI
		Instantiate a hangman object, and run it using a gui
		Should all the user to type in characters, have them appear as either correct or incorrect
		Button for start over/reset
		Start game, type in custom word (up to 16 characters due to LCD)
		Launcher allows to choose which com port to run off of
			Perhaps with a drop-down (comboBox?)
	LCD:
		Adapted the I2C LCD to take in 32 characters to display
	7-seg:
		Apparently this needs to show the number of guesses remaining.  Can this not be on the LCD?
	PC-FPGA Communications
		PC-Side:	
			Interrupt-based listener. Always wait for input from the FPGA when the game is running
			Send all 32 characters of the LCD back to the FPGA once received something
			Using this Java Package: https://fazecast.github.io/jSerialComm/
		FPGA-Side:
			Send single character from the keyboard whenever it is received.
			Be ready to accept 32 characters from the PC basically whenever (after sending and otherwise, since game start/end, etc.
	Keyboard
		Get PS2 keyboard working with the FPGA.
		Send character to PC after release
			Sequence: Pressed - Released >>> SCAN_CODE - 0F, SCAN_CODE
